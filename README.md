# INTERNPE_IPl_PREDICTION
IPL Match Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the total score of an IPL match based on various features, including runs, overs, and runs in the last 5 overs.
The dataset used for the analysis contains historical IPL data, with teams' performances and scores.
The machine learning model used is a Linear Regression model, which is trained on historical match data to predict the total score of a team based on these features.
>>Features
->Data Exploration & Visualization: Visualizing data to understand relationships between features.
->Model Training & Evaluation: Training the Linear Regression model to predict the total score.
->Prediction: Users can input the number of runs, overs, and runs in the last 5 overs, and the model will predict the total score.
->Visuals: Provides multiple plots to visualize the correlation between features, score distribution, actual vs. predicted scores, and batting teamsâ€™ final scores.
